          My journey in the digital world began in 2008, at the age of 8, when I
          created a blog about Club Penguin and started experimenting with web
          development. This sparked my passion for technology and online
          communities.

          A few years later, in 2011, I discovered Minecraft, and by 2013, I had
          launched my first Minecraft server. By 2017, I owned and operated the{" "}
          <a className="link" href="https://redesky.com">
            largest Minecraft network in Brazil
          </a>
          , which peaked at 8,115 concurrent players. Leading a talented team of
          developers and game designers, we provided an engaging platform for a
          thriving community of over 300K monthly players.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022, I transitioned away from Minecraft to fully focus on
          advancing my career as a Software Engineer. I am now pursuing a degree
          in Software Engineering at PUC Minas, channeling my skills and
          experience into new challenges and projects.
